Progress on the spawning system so far :

1. There is now timed delay on the spawning system.
2. Time Inconsistency so far is 0.
3. Prototype 1 seams to be a success.

Update:

	1. Recent test show little or not Time Inconsistencies.
	2. An Interactable Prototype is now being created.
	3. The prototype will now utilize the enemies killed variable to know when to spawn.
	4. It would be fun to also use both ways, using the enemies killed and also using the Time Mechanics
	5. So far it has been a Success.
